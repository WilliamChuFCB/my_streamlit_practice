# my_streamlit_practice

This is a repo for deploying an streamlit app.

In this app, I use pre-trained YOLOv5 model to conduct object detection. When a user upload an image containing some recognizable objects, this app will return a image with bounding boxes, which indicate the locations and classes of the objects within the image.

You can access the web app here: [visit my streamlit app]('https://myapppractice-eslxambkeygeazvrsjfxon.streamlit.app/')
